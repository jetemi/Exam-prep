**1a Human Computer Interaction (HCI) Components and Norman's Principles (7½mks)**

**(i) What are the 3 main components of Human Computer Interaction (HCI)?** (3mks)

The three main components of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) are:

*   **User:**  The person who interacts with the computer system.
*   **Computer:** The technology, ranging from desktop computers to mobile devices and beyond.
*   **Interaction:** The process of communication and exchange between the user and the computer.

**(ii) To assess the interaction between human and computers, Donald Norman in 1988 proposed seven principles that can be used to transform difficult tasks. State these principles.** (4½mks)

Donald Norman's seven principles of design are:

*   **Visibility:**  Making relevant parts of the system visible and easily discoverable.
*   **Feedback:**  Providing users with clear and immediate feedback on their actions.
*   **Constraints:**  Limiting the number of possible actions to prevent errors and guide users.
*   **Consistency:**  Maintaining consistent design across the interface in terms of layout, terminology, and actions.
*   **Affordance:**  Designing elements so that their purpose is clear from their appearance (e.g., buttons look pressable).
*   **Discoverability:**  Making it easy for users to find and learn how to use different features of the system.
*   **Mapping:**  Establishing a clear and intuitive relationship between controls and their effects in the real world.

*   **Prevent errors:** Design the interface to minimize errors and provide helpful error messages when they occur.
*   **Permit easy reversal of actions:** Allow users to easily undo actions to encourage exploration and reduce anxiety.
*   **Keep users in control:**  Give users a sense of control and avoid forcing them into unwanted actions.
*   **Reduce short-term memory load:** Minimize the amount of information users need to remember while using the system.


**2b Keyboard vs. Speech Input and HCI Design Guidelines (14mks)**

**(ii) Describe three situations in which keyboard input might be preferred over speech for data entry.** (5mks)

Three situations where keyboard input might be preferred over speech:

*   **Confidential Data Entry:**  Typing is more private and secure than speaking sensitive information aloud in public or shared spaces.
*   **Noisy Environments:** Speech recognition accuracy can be significantly reduced in noisy environments, making keyboard input more reliable.
*   **Technical or Specialized Vocabulary:** Keyboards are often more efficient and accurate for entering complex technical terms, code, or specialized vocabulary that speech recognition may misinterpret.

**(iii) Briefly describe the following categories of HCI design guidelines:** (9mks)

**(i) General Interaction:**

*   Focuses on the overall interaction style and flow of the system.

*   Ensures a smooth and intuitive user experience across the system.

**(ii) Information Display:**

*   Deals with how information is presented to the user on the interface.
*   Guidelines related to visual clarity, organization, use of graphics, typography, and color.
*   Aims to make information easily understandable and accessible to users.

**(iii) Data Entry:**

*   Concentrates on making data input efficient, accurate, and user-friendly.
*   Guidelines related to input validation, clear prompts, appropriate input methods (keyboard, form fields, etc.), and error handling during data entry.
*   Reduces user errors and improves data quality.


**3a Nielsen's Heuristics and User Interaction Ways (11mks)**

**(i) Highlight six principles of Nielsen that serves as a checklist in evaluating and explaining problems for the heuristic evaluator while auditing an interface or a product.** (6mks)

Six of Nielsen's 10 Heuristics for Heuristic Evaluation:

*   **Visibility of system status:**  The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within a reasonable time.
*   **Match between system and the real world:** The system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.
*   **User control and freedom:** Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.
*   **Consistency and standards:** Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.
*   **Error prevention:** Even better than good error messages is careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place.
*   **Recognition rather than recall:** Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another.


**(ii) Describe the five ways by which a user interacts with the application.** (5mks)

Five ways a user interacts with an application:

*   **Input:**  Providing data or commands to the application (e.g., typing, clicking, speaking).
*   **Output:** Receiving information or feedback from the application (e.g., text, graphics, sounds).
*   **Feedback:**  Receiving responses from the application to user actions, confirming actions or indicating status.
*   **Control:**  Directing the application's behavior and flow (e.g., navigating menus, starting/stopping processes).
*   **Navigation:**  Moving through different parts of the application's interface and content.
