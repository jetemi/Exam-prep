**1a Human Computer Interaction (HCI) Components and Norman's Principles (7½mks)**

**(i) What are the 3 main components of Human Computer Interaction (HCI)?** (3mks)

*   **User:**  The person who interacts with the computer system.
*   **Computer:** The technology, ranging from desktop computers to mobile devices and beyond.
*   **Interaction:** The process of communication and exchange between the user and the computer.

**(ii) To assess the interaction between human and computers, Donald Norman in 1988 proposed seven principles that can be used to transform difficult tasks. State these principles.** (4½mks)

1. **Use both knowledge in the world and knowledge in the head.**
2. **Simplify the structure of tasks.**
3. **Make things visible.**
4. **Get the mappings right** between user intentions and system controls.
5. **Exploit the power of constraints**, both natural and artificial. E.g Limiting the number of possible actions to prevent errors and guide users.
6. **Design for error**, anticipating human mistakes.
7. **When all else fails, standardize:** If there are no natural mappings then arbitrary mappings should be standardized so that users only have to learn them once.


**1b Types of User Interface (10mks)**

**(i) Graphical User Interface (GUI):**

*   Uses visual elements like icons, menus, windows, and buttons.
*   Users interact through direct manipulation using a mouse, touchpad, or touchscreen.
*   Focuses on visual representation and ease of use.
*   Examples: Windows, macOS, Android, iOS.
*   Often referred to as WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointers)

**(ii) Touchscreen:**

*   A display screen that is sensitive to touch input.
*   Allows users to interact directly with the interface by touching the screen.
*   Commonly used in smartphones, tablets, kiosks, and interactive displays.
*   Supports gestures like tapping, swiping, and pinching for interaction.

**(iii) Menu-Driven Interface:**

*   Presents users with a list of options (menus) to choose from.
*   Interaction is based on navigating through hierarchical menus to select commands or actions.
*   Often used in applications with a limited set of functions or in embedded systems, eg, ATM Machines.
*   Can be less flexible than other interfaces but is generally easy to learn.

**(iv) Command Line Interface (CLI):**

*   Users interact by typing text-based commands.
*   Provides powerful control and flexibility for experienced users.
*   Requires users to learn specific commands and syntax.
*   Examples: Command Prompt, Terminal, Linux shell.

**(v) Conversational User Interface (CUI):**

*   Enables interaction through natural language, either spoken or written.
*   Uses chatbots, voice assistants, and messaging interfaces.
*   Aims for a more natural and intuitive interaction style.
*   Examples: Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant, chatbots in messaging apps.


**1c (i) Various methodologies have materialized since the inception that outlines the techniques for Human Computer Interaction. Highlight four design methodologies commonly in use today.** (6mks)

*   **User-Centered Design (UCD):**  Focuses on understanding user needs, goals, and contexts throughout the design process. Involves user research, iterative design, and usability testing.
*   **Task Analysis:**  Involves breaking down user tasks into smaller steps to understand how users currently perform tasks and identify areas for improvement.
*   **Scenario-Based Design:**  Uses narratives or stories (scenarios) to describe how users might interact with a system in specific situations. Helps designers envision user interactions and design for real-world use cases.
*   **Agile UX:**  Integrates UX design principles into agile software development methodologies. Emphasizes iterative design, rapid prototyping, and continuous user feedback within short development cycles.

**(ii) There are a large number of factors which should be considered in the analysis and design of a system using HCI principles. Itemize any seven main factors that you know of.** (6½mks)

*   **Usability:**  The ease of use and effectiveness of the system, including learnability, efficiency, memorability, error handling, and satisfaction.
*   **Accessibility:**  Designing systems that are usable by people with a wide range of abilities and disabilities.
*   **User Experience (UX):**  The overall experience a user has while interacting with a system, encompassing usability, aesthetics, emotion, and value.
*   **Functionality:**  Ensuring the system provides the necessary features and functions to meet user needs and goals.
*   **Aesthetics:**  The visual appeal and attractiveness of the interface, contributing to user satisfaction and engagement.
*   **Efficiency:**  How quickly and easily users can accomplish their tasks using the system.
*   **Learnability:**  How easy it is for new users to learn to use the system effectively.


**2a(i) What essential characteristics of good design are often summarized through Shneiderman's 8 Golden Rules that help interface designers? (6mks)**

1.   **Strive for consistency**
2.   **Enable frequent users to use shortcuts** 
3.   **Offer informative feedback**
4.   **Design dialogs to yield closure**
5.   **Offer error prevention and simple error handling**
6.   **Permit easy reversal of actions**
7.   **Support internal locus of control**
8.   **Reduce short-term memory load**


**2b (ii) Describe three situations in which keyboard input might be preferred over speech for data entry.** (5mks)

*   **Confidentiality and Privacy:**  Typing is more private and secure than speaking sensitive information aloud in public or shared spaces.
*   **Noisy Environments:** Speech recognition accuracy can be significantly reduced in noisy environments, making keyboard input more reliable.
*   **Precision and speed for experts:** Keyboards are often more efficient and accurate for entering complex technical terms, code, or specialized vocabulary that speech recognition may misinterpret.

**(iii) Briefly describe the following categories of HCI design guidelines:** (9mks)

**(i) General Interaction:**

*   Focuses on the overall interaction style and flow of the system.
*   Guidelines related to consistency, feedback, error prevention, and user control.
*   Ensures a smooth and intuitive user experience across the system.

**(ii) Information Display:**

*   Deals with how information is presented to the user on the interface.
*   Guidelines related to visual clarity, organization, use of graphics, typography, and color.
*   Aims to make information easily understandable and accessible to users.

**(iii) Data Entry:**

*   Concentrates on making data input efficient, accurate, and user-friendly.
*   Guidelines related to input validation, clear prompts, appropriate input methods (keyboard, form fields, etc.), and error handling during data entry.
*   Reduces user errors and improves data quality.


**3a Nielsen's Heuristics and User Interaction Ways (11mks)**

**(i) Highlight six principles of Nielsen that serves as a checklist in evaluating and explaining problems for the heuristic evaluator while auditing an interface or a product.** (6mks)

Six of Nielsen's 10 Heuristics for Heuristic Evaluation:

*   **Visibility of system status:**  The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within a reasonable time.
*   **Match between system and the real world:** The system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.
*   **User control and freedom:** Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.
*   **Consistency and standards:** Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.
*   **Error prevention:** Even better than good error messages is careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place.
*   **Recognition rather than recall:** Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another.


**(ii) Describe the five ways by which a user interacts with the application.** (5mks)

*   **Input:**  Providing data or commands to the application (e.g., typing, clicking, speaking).
*   **Output:** Receiving information or feedback from the application (e.g., text, graphics, sounds).
*   **Feedback:**  Receiving responses from the application to user actions, confirming actions or indicating status.
*   **Control:**  Directing the application's behavior and flow (e.g., navigating menus, starting/stopping processes).
*   **Navigation:**  Moving through different parts of the application's interface and content.


**3b (iii) Write short notes on the following commonly used software tools in HCI:**

**(i) Specification Methods:**

*   Tools and techniques used to document and define user requirements and system specifications for HCI design.
*   Examples include:
    *   **Use Case Diagrams:**  Visual representations of user interactions with the system to achieve specific goals.
    *   **User Stories:**  Short, simple descriptions of features told from the user's perspective.
    *   **Wireframes:**  Low-fidelity visual representations of interface layouts, focusing on structure and content placement.

**(ii) Transition Diagram:**

*   Visual tools that represent the different states of a user interface and the possible transitions between these states.
*   Used to design and visualize the flow of user interaction and navigation within an application.
*   Help ensure that the user interface is logically structured and easy to navigate.

**(iii) Interface Building Tools:**

*   Software and libraries that simplify and accelerate the process of creating user interfaces.
*   Examples include:
    *   **GUI Builders:**  Visual development environments that allow designers to drag and drop UI elements and configure their properties (e.g., Qt Designer, Windows Forms Designer).

**(ii) HCI design is considered as a problem-solving process that has components like planned usage, target area, resources, cost, and viability. Itemize the four basic activities of interaction design.** (4mks)

Four basic activities of interaction design:

*   **Requirements / Discovering (or Understanding):**  Understanding the users, their needs, context of use, and the problem domain. This involves user research, requirements gathering, and analysis.
*   **Analysis:** ordering results to identify key issues
*   **Designing:**  Creating conceptual and concrete designs for the interaction, including interface design, navigation, and functionality.
*   **Iteration and prototyping:**  Building interactive prototypes to visualize and test design ideas. Prototypes can range from low-fidelity paper prototypes to high-fidelity interactive mockups.
*   (bonus) **Evaluating:**  Assessing the usability and user experience of the design through user testing, heuristic evaluation, and other evaluation methods. This informs iterative design improvements.


**4b (iii) Write short notes on the following terms as used in the concept of usability:**

**(i) Usability Study:**

*   An assessment of a system's functionality and usability from the human perspective to see if it satisfies user needs.
*   Involves observing users as they interact with the system to identify usability problems and areas for improvement.
*   Can include various methods like usability testing, field studies, surveys, and expert reviews.

**(ii) Usability Testing:**

*   Actual testing of the system with the intended users to measure performance and experience.
*   Researchers collect data on user performance, errors, and satisfaction.
*   Aims to identify usability issues and gather user feedback to improve the design.

**(iii) Acceptance Testing:**

*   Testing conducted to determine if a product or system meets the user's needs and requirements and is acceptable for deployment or release.
*   Often performed at the end of the development process.
*   Focuses on verifying that the system is usable, functional, and meets predefined acceptance criteria.

*   **Put the user first**
*   **Keep the user in the center** throughout the process
*   **Remember the user at the end** of the design cycle

**(ii) A dialog is the construction of interaction between two or more beings or systems studied at three levels in HCI. Outline the three levels of a dialog in HCI.** (4mks)

*   **Lexical**: the lowest level, dealing with basic input/output mechanics.
*   **Syntactic**: the middle level, defining the structure of the conversation or sequence of actions.
