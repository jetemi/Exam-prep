**Question 4**

**(a) What is a system? Give two examples of a system.** (4 marks)

*   **Definition of a System:** A system is a set of interrelated components working together towards a common goal or purpose. These components interact and are interdependent, forming a unified whole that is more than the sum of its parts. A system operates within an environment and has a defined boundary that separates it from that environment.

*   **Examples of Systems:**
    1.  **University System**
    2.  **Banking System**
    3.  **Library System (Information System)**
    4.  **Traffic Light System (Control System/Embedded System)**

**(b) Define the following:** (5 marks each - Total 15 marks)

**(i) System Analysis:** The process of studying a system to understand its components, interactions, boundaries, and environment. It involves investigating problems, identifying needs, and recommending solutions for improvement or development of a new system. System analysis focuses on understanding the "what" and "why" of a system – what it does, what its goals are, and why it functions the way it does. It's about defining the problem and the requirements for a solution.

**(ii) System Design:** The process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It translates the requirements identified in system analysis into a blueprint for how the system will be built. System design focuses on the "how" – how the system will be implemented, how it will function, and how it will meet the defined requirements. It involves making decisions about hardware, software, data structures, user interfaces, and processes.

**(c) List and briefly explain the three elements of a system.** (9 marks)

1.  **Components (or Subsystems):** The individual parts or modules that make up the system. Components can be physical (hardware, equipment) or conceptual (software modules, departments, processes).  They are distinct units but are interconnected and work together.
    *   **Example:** In a computer system, components include the CPU, memory, storage devices, input/output devices, operating system, and application software.

2.  **Interrelationships (or Interfaces):** The connections and interactions between the components of a system. These relationships define how components communicate, exchange data, and work together to achieve the system's purpose. Interrelationships can be physical connections, data flows, control signals, or logical dependencies.
    *   **Example:** In a university system, the interrelationship between the library and students is that students can borrow books from the library. The interrelationship between departments is that they may share resources or collaborate on research projects.

3.  **Objectives (or Goals/Purpose):** This is the reason the system exists. It's the intended outcome or the desired result that the system is designed to achieve. Every system is created with a specific objective in mind. The objectives define the system's function and provide a direction for its operation. A well-defined objective is crucial for designing and evaluating a system.
    *   **Example:**  The objective is to regulate traffic flow at intersections to prevent accidents, improve traffic efficiency, and ensure the safe movement of vehicles and pedestrians.

**Question 5**

**(a) i. What is System development life cycle (SDLC)?** (5 marks)

*   **System Development Life Cycle (SDLC):** A structured, phased approach to planning, creating, testing, and deploying an information system. It provides a framework that outlines the stages involved in developing a system from initial conception to retirement.  The SDLC ensures a systematic and disciplined approach to system development, helping to manage complexity, reduce risks, and improve the quality of the final system. It's a project management tool for IT projects.

**(ii) List and explain the five types of problems that may be encountered during problem identification.** (5 marks)

1.  **Ambiguity:** Lack of clarity in the problem statement leads to different interpretations and makes it hard to define requirements.
2.  **Conflicting Views:** Different stakeholders have different perceptions or understandings of the problem, leading to disagreements on what the actual problem is and what needs to be solved.
3.  **Symptoms vs. Root Cause Confusion:** Addressing symptoms might provide temporary relief, but the problem will likely reoccur if the root cause is not identified and resolved.
4.  **Scope Creep:**  The problem definition keeps expanding or changing during the problem identification phase, making it difficult to define a clear and manageable scope.
5.  **Lack of Measurable Objectives:** Without measurable objectives, it's hard to track progress, evaluate success, and ensure that the system development efforts are aligned with desired outcomes.

**(b) Explain why Economic feasibility is very paramount in systems analysis.** (7 marks)

1.  **Resource Allocation:** Organizations have limited resources (budget, time, personnel). Economic feasibility helps prioritize projects and allocate resources to those that offer the best return on investment (ROI).
2.  **Justification for Investment:**  Developing information systems requires significant investment. Economic feasibility provides a business case to justify these investments to stakeholders (management, investors) by demonstrating the potential financial benefits.
3.  **Cost Control:**  By analyzing costs upfront, economic feasibility helps to control development costs and prevent projects from exceeding budget.
4.  **Risk Assessment:**  Economic feasibility includes assessing financial risks associated with the project, such as cost overruns, delays, and failure to achieve expected benefits.
5.  **Decision Making:**  Provides critical information for decision-makers to decide whether to proceed with a project, modify its scope, or abandon it if it's not economically viable.
6.  **Return on Investment (ROI):**  Focuses on calculating and maximizing the ROI of the system.  Ensures that the system will generate sufficient financial benefits (increased revenue, cost savings, efficiency gains) to justify the investment.
7.  **Long-Term Sustainability:**  Ensures that the system is not only technically feasible but also economically sustainable in the long run, considering ongoing operational and maintenance costs.

**(c) Briefly explain the following:** (3 marks each - Total 6 marks)

**(i) Adaptive maintenance.**

    *   Modifying a system to comply with new government regulations.
    *   Updating a system to integrate with a new software platform or operating system.
    *   Adding new features to support changing business processes or customer needs.

**(ii) Perfective maintenance.**

*   **Perfective Maintenance:**  Making enhancements or improvements to a system to improve its performance, efficiency, maintainability, or user satisfaction. It's about making a good system even better, even if there are no specific errors or new requirements.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Optimizing system code to improve processing speed.
    *   Redesigning user interfaces to enhance usability.
    *   Adding new documentation or help features to make the system easier to use and maintain.
