**(c) (i) Define System Design** (3 marks)

*   **System Design:** The phase in the SDLC where the requirements gathered during system analysis are translated into a detailed blueprint or specification for how the system will be built. It involves defining the system architecture, components, modules, interfaces, data structures, processes, and user interfaces. System design focuses on the "how" of the system â€“ how it will meet the functional and non-functional requirements.

**(ii) Briefly explain the four important aspects on which system design is focused** (8 marks)

1.  **Architecture Design:**  Defining the overall structure and organization of the system. This includes choosing the system architecture (e.g., client-server, web-based, cloud-based), identifying major components and their relationships, and defining system boundaries.
2.  **Interface Design:** Designing the interfaces between system components, between the system and external systems, and most importantly, the user interface. This includes designing user screens, menus, reports, and interactions to ensure usability and effective communication.
3.  **Data Design:**  Designing the database structure and data storage mechanisms. This involves defining data entities, attributes, relationships, data types, and data access methods.  Ensuring data integrity, security, and efficient data management are key.
4.  **Process Design:**  Defining the processes and algorithms that the system will perform to achieve its functions. This includes designing program logic, workflows, control flows, and algorithms for data processing and manipulation.  Ensuring efficiency, accuracy, and reliability of processes is crucial.

**Question 2**

**(a) Briefly describe the following system development models and list the steps involved when they are deployed:** (6 marks each - Total 18 marks)

**(i) Waterfall**

*   **Description:** A linear, sequential model where each phase of system development is completed in order before moving to the next. Progress flows downwards like a waterfall. It's a structured and rigid approach, suitable for projects with well-defined and stable requirements.
*   **Steps Involved:**
    1.  **Requirements Analysis:** Gather and document all system requirements.
    2.  **System Design:** Design the system architecture, components, and interfaces.
    3.  **Implementation (Coding):** Write the program code.

**(ii) Spiral**

*   **Description:** A risk-driven, iterative model that combines elements of waterfall and prototyping. Development progresses in cycles (spirals), with each cycle involving planning, risk analysis, engineering (development), and evaluation. Risk assessment is a central activity in each iteration to identify and mitigate potential problems. Suitable for complex projects with evolving requirements and high risks.
*   **Steps Involved (within each spiral iteration):**
    1.  **Planning:** Determine objectives, alternatives, and constraints for this iteration.
    2.  **Risk Analysis:** Identify, assess, and resolve risks associated with the chosen approach.
    3.  **Engineering (Development & Testing):** Design, implement, and test the current iteration's functionalities.
    4.  **Evaluation (Customer Evaluation):** Evaluate the results, get feedback from stakeholders, and plan for the next iteration.
    *   *These steps are repeated in each spiral until the system is complete.*

**(iii) Prototyping**

*   **Description:** An iterative model where a working model (prototype) of the system is developed quickly to demonstrate functionality and gather user feedback. Prototypes are refined based on feedback until they evolve into the final system or are used to clarify requirements. Focuses on user interaction and early validation.
*   **Steps Involved:**
    1.  **Identify Basic Requirements:** Gather initial, high-level requirements.
    2.  **Develop a Prototype:** Create a working model of the system or key parts.
    3.  **User Evaluation:** Users test and provide feedback on the prototype.
    4.  **Refine Prototype:** Based on feedback, refine and enhance the prototype (repeat steps 3 & 4 iteratively).
    5.  **Implement and Test Final System (or Use Prototype as Basis):** Once the prototype is satisfactory, either evolve it into the final system or use the refined requirements from prototyping to develop the final system using another SDLC model.

**(b) Explain the three types of maintenance used after system implementation** (6 marks)

1.  **Corrective Maintenance:**  Performed to fix errors or defects in the system that were not detected during testing. It's about "correcting" problems and restoring the system to its intended functionality.
2.  **Adaptive Maintenance:**  Performed to modify the system to adapt to new business requirements or technological changes in the environment. It's about "adapting" the system to remain relevant and compatible with its evolving surroundings.
3.  **Perfective Maintenance:**  Performed to improve the system's performance, efficiency, maintainability, or user satisfaction. It's about "perfecting" the system and making it better, even if there are no specific errors or new requirements.

**Question 3**

**(a) Define system** (4 marks)

*   **Definition of a System:** A system is a set of interacting or interdependent components forming an integrated whole. These components work together to achieve a common objective or set of objectives. Systems operate within an environment, have defined boundaries, and receive inputs, process them, and produce outputs.  Key aspects are interdependence, common purpose, and interaction with an environment.

**(b) Explain the following: i. Boundary and environment ii. Subsystem iii. Interface iv. Feedback control v. Black box** (10 marks)

**(i) Boundary and Environment:**
*   **Boundary:** The demarcation line that separates a system from its environment. It defines what is inside the system and what is outside. Boundaries can be physical or conceptual. They help to define the scope and limits of the system.
*   **Environment:** Everything outside the system's boundary that can influence or be influenced by the system. The environment provides inputs to the system and receives outputs from it. Systems interact with their environment by exchanging resources, information, or energy.

**(ii) Subsystem:** A component or part of a larger system that is itself a system. Subsystems have their own boundaries, components, and objectives, but they contribute to the overall functioning and goals of the larger system. Complex systems are often composed of multiple interacting subsystems.

**(iii) Interface:**
*   **Interface:** The point of interaction or communication between two components, subsystems, or between a system and its environment. Interfaces define how components exchange data, signals, or energy. 

**(iv) Feedback Control:** A mechanism within a system that monitors the output of the system and uses that information (feedback) to adjust the input or internal processes to maintain a desired state or achieve a goal. Feedback loops are essential for self-regulation and adaptation in systems.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Positive Feedback:** Amplifies change, moving the system further away from equilibrium. (e.g., compound interest).
    *   **Negative Feedback:** Counteracts change, bringing the system back towards equilibrium or a set point. (e.g., thermostat regulating temperature).

**(v) Black Box:** Is a system or component whose internal workings are hidden or not considered.  When viewing something as a black box, we are only concerned with its inputs and outputs, and not with its internal processes or implementation. This abstraction simplifies understanding and managing complex systems by focusing on external behavior rather than internal details.

**(c) (i) Define Systems Analysis.** (5 marks)

*   **System Analysis:** The process of studying a system to understand its functions, components, interactions, boundaries, and environment. It involves investigating problems, identifying needs, and defining requirements for a new or improved system. System analysis focuses on understanding the current system (if it exists), identifying problems and opportunities, and determining what the new system should do to meet user needs and business goals. It's about problem definition and requirements gathering.

**(ii) List the advantages of Systems Analysis.** (5 marks)

1.  **Clearer Understanding of Problems:** System analysis provides a structured way to investigate and understand complex problems within an organization or system.
2.  **Well-Defined Requirements:** It results in clearly defined, documented, and validated requirements for a new or improved system, reducing ambiguity and misunderstandings.
3.  **Improved Communication:** Facilitates communication between stakeholders (users, analysts, developers) by providing a common understanding of the system and its requirements.
4.  **Better Decision Making:**  Provides information and analysis to support informed decisions about system design, development, and implementation.
5.  **Reduced Development Costs and Risks:** Early identification of problems and clear requirements reduces the risk of costly errors, rework, and project failures later in the development process.
6.  **Increased System Effectiveness:** By focusing on user needs and business goals, system analysis helps to develop systems that are more effective and better aligned with organizational objectives.
7.  **Optimized Processes:**  Analysis of existing systems can identify inefficiencies and opportunities for process improvement.
