**Question 1**

**(a) List the seven main components of a (qualitative) research report. (7 marks)**

1.  **Abstract/Executive Summary:**  A concise overview of the entire research report, usually about 150-250 words. It summarizes the research problem, methodology, key findings, and conclusions. It should be informative enough to stand alone and give the reader a quick understanding of the research.

2.  **Introduction:** This section sets the stage for the research. It includes:
    *   **Background of the Study:** Contextual information about the research topic, explaining its relevance and significance.
    *   **Statement of the Problem:** Clearly defines the research problem or question being investigated.
    *   **Purpose of the Study:**  States the overall aim and objectives of the research.
    *   **Research Questions (or Hypotheses in some cases, though less common in qualitative):** Specific questions the research seeks to answer.
    *   **Significance of the Study:** Explains the potential contribution and importance of the research findings.

3.  **Literature Review:** This section provides a critical analysis of existing literature relevant to the research topic. It demonstrates the researcher's understanding of the current knowledge base, identifies gaps in the literature, and justifies the need for the current study. It should:
    *   Summarize and synthesize key findings from previous research.
    *   Identify theoretical frameworks relevant to the study.
    *   Critically evaluate existing studies, highlighting strengths and weaknesses.
    *   Show how the current research builds upon or diverges from previous work.

4.  **Methodology:** This section details how the research was conducted. It must be transparent and rigorous to ensure the study's credibility. For qualitative research, this includes:
    *   **Research Design:** Describes the overall approach (e.g., case study, ethnography, phenomenology, grounded theory).
    *   **Participants/Sample:**  Explains how participants were selected and describes their characteristics. In qualitative research, sampling is often purposive or snowball, focusing on information-rich cases.
    *   **Data Collection Methods:** Describes the methods used to gather data (e.g., interviews, focus groups, observations, document analysis).  Provides details about the instruments or protocols used.
    *   **Data Analysis Techniques:** Explains how the data was analyzed (e.g., thematic analysis, content analysis, discourse analysis).  Describes the process of coding, categorizing, and interpreting the data.
    *   **Ethical Considerations:**  Addresses ethical issues related to the research, such as informed consent, confidentiality, anonymity, and data security.

5.  **Findings/Results:** This section presents the key findings of the research in a clear and organized manner. In qualitative research, findings are often presented as:
    *   **Themes and Categories:**  Identified from the data analysis.
    *   **Narrative Descriptions:**  Rich, detailed accounts of the data, often including direct quotes from participants to illustrate themes.
    *   **Visual Representations (if applicable):**  Tables, figures, or diagrams that summarize or illustrate findings.
    *   **Avoidance of Statistical Generalization:** Qualitative findings are typically not statistically generalizable to a larger population but aim for in-depth understanding within the studied context.

6.  **Discussion/Conclusion:** This section interprets the findings, relates them back to the research questions and literature, and discusses their implications. It includes:
    *   **Interpretation of Findings:**  Explains the meaning and significance of the results in relation to the research problem and existing literature.
    *   **Comparison with Literature:**  Discusses how the findings align with or contradict previous research.
    *   **Implications of the Study:**  Explores the practical or theoretical implications of the findings.  What do the results mean for practice, policy, or future research?
    *   **Limitations of the Study:** Acknowledges any limitations of the research design, sample, data collection, or analysis that might affect the findings' generalizability or validity.
    *   **Recommendations for Future Research:**  Suggests areas for further investigation based on the study's findings and limitations.
    *   **Conclusion:**  Summarizes the main findings and overall conclusions of the research, reiterating the study's contribution.

7.  **References/Bibliography:**  A complete list of all sources cited in the research report, formatted according to a chosen referencing style (e.g., APA, Vancouver). This ensures proper attribution and allows readers to locate the sources.

**(b) Highlight three things to do in order to avoid plagiarism in your research. (3 marks)**

1.  **Proper Citation and Referencing:**  This is the most crucial step.  Whenever you use someone else's ideas, words, data, or any form of intellectual property, you **must** give them credit through proper citation. This includes:
    *   **In-text citations:**  Within the body of your text, indicate the source immediately after the borrowed material.  Use the chosen referencing style (APA, Vancouver, etc.) correctly.
    *   **Reference list/Bibliography:** At the end of your report, provide a complete and accurately formatted list of all sources cited.

2.  **Paraphrasing and Summarizing Effectively:** Don't just copy and paste text. Learn to **paraphrase** (express someone else's ideas in your own words) and **summarize** (condense the main points of a text).  Even when paraphrasing or summarizing, you still need to cite the original source.  Effective paraphrasing involves changing both the wording and sentence structure, not just replacing a few words.

3.  **Use Quotation Marks for Direct Quotes:**  If you use the exact words of another author, enclose them in **quotation marks**.  Direct quotes should be used sparingly and only when the original wording is particularly important or impactful.  Always cite the source of a direct quote.  Be sure to transcribe quotes accurately.

**(c) What is the difference between APA and Vancouver referencing format? (2 marks)**

APA (American Psychological Association) and Vancouver are two common referencing styles, but they differ significantly in their format and approach:

| Feature                  | APA Style                                      | Vancouver Style                                    |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Discipline Primarily Used In** | Social Sciences, Psychology, Education, Business | Medicine, Health Sciences, Natural Sciences, Engineering |
| **In-text Citation Style** | **Author-Date System:**  (Author, Year, page number - if available) within the text. Example: (Smith, 2023, p. 45) | **Numeric System:**  Uses numbers in superscript or in brackets within the text, referring to a numbered list of references at the end. Example: Smith<sup>1</sup> or Smith [1] |
| **Reference List Style** | **Alphabetical Order:** References are listed alphabetically by the first author's last name. | **Numeric Order:** References are listed numerically in the order they appear in the text. |
| **Author Names in Reference List** | Last name, First initial(s). Example: Smith, J.K. | Last name and initials (no periods after initials). Example: Smith JK |
| **Journal Titles in Reference List** | Full journal titles are used.                  | Abbreviated journal titles are often used (based on standardized abbreviations like those in Index Medicus). |
| **Book Titles in Reference List** | Capitalize only the first word of the title and subtitle, and proper nouns. | Capitalize only the first word of the title and subtitle, and proper nouns. |
| **Emphasis**             | Author and date are emphasized in text.        |  Source and sequence are emphasized in text.        |

**(d) What do you understand by Intellectual Property (IP) and list any five types of IP Rights (IPR) you have studied. (5 marks)**

**Intellectual Property (IP):** Refers to creations of the mind, such as inventions; literary and artistic works; designs; and symbols, names and images used in commerce.  Essentially, IP is a legal concept that grants exclusive rights to creators over their creations. These rights protect the creators' interests by giving them control over how their creations are used, often for a certain period.

**Five Types of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR):**

1.  **Copyright:** Protects original works of authorship, such as literary works (books, articles, software code), artistic works (music, paintings, photographs, films), and dramatic works. Copyright grants the creator exclusive rights to control copying, distribution, adaptation, public performance, and display of their work. Copyright protection is usually automatic upon creation and lasts for the life of the author plus a certain number of years (e.g., 70 years post-mortem in many countries).

2.  **Patents:** Protect inventions, which are new, useful, and non-obvious solutions to technological problems. A patent grants the inventor exclusive rights to exclude others from making, using, selling, and importing the invention for a limited period (typically 20 years from the filing date). To be patentable, an invention must meet specific criteria of novelty, inventiveness (non-obviousness), and industrial applicability.

3.  **Trademarks:** Protect brand names and logos used to identify and distinguish goods and services of one undertaking from those of others. A trademark can be a word, symbol, design, or a combination of these. Trademark rights allow the owner to prevent others from using confusingly similar marks on related goods or services. Trademark protection can be perpetual as long as the mark is in use and renewal fees are paid.

4.  **Industrial Designs:** (Also known as design patents or design rights in some jurisdictions) Protect the ornamental or aesthetic aspects of an article. They cover the visual appearance of a product, such as its shape, configuration, patterns, or ornamentation. Industrial design protection prevents others from making, selling, or importing articles that embody or incorporate the protected design. Protection is typically for a limited period, often renewable.

5.  **Trade Secrets:**  Protect confidential information that provides a business with a competitive edge. Trade secrets can include formulas, practices, designs, instruments, or a compilation of information. Unlike other IPRs, trade secrets are not registered but are protected as long as the information remains confidential and provides a commercial advantage. Protection lasts indefinitely as long as secrecy is maintained. Examples include the recipe for Coca-Cola or Google's search algorithm.

**(e) Write briefly on 'Patency' as a form of IPR. (2 marks)**

**Patency** (more accurately referred to as **Patents** or **Patent Protection**) is a significant form of Intellectual Property Right (IPR) designed to protect **inventions**, which are new, useful, and non-obvious solutions to technological problems. A patent grants the inventor exclusive rights to exclude others from making, using, selling, and importing the invention for a limited period (typically 20 years from the filing date). To be patentable, an invention must meet specific criteria of novelty, inventiveness (non-obviousness), and industrial applicability.

**Question 2**

**(a) What do you understand by Research? (2 marks)**

**Research** is a systematic and organized process of investigation and discovery aimed at expanding knowledge, understanding, and solving problems. It involves asking questions, collecting data, analyzing information, and drawing conclusions to contribute to a body of knowledge.

**(b) Briefly differentiate between Basic and Applied Research. (3 marks)**

| Feature         | Basic Research                                   | Applied Research                                     |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Goal**| Expand fundamental knowledge, theory.              | Solve practical problems, create applications.        |
| **Motivation**  | Curiosity, knowledge for its own sake ("why").     | Practical need, problem-solving ("how").             |
| **Focus**       | Theories, principles, general understanding.        | Practical solutions, technologies, interventions.   |
| **Timeframe**   | Often long-term.                                 | Often shorter-term.                                  |
| **Outcome**     | New theories, fundamental knowledge.               | Practical solutions, improved processes, new products. |
| **Example**     | Investigating the fundamental principles of quantum computing, exploring the nature of dark matter, studying the origins of the universe.               | Developing a new algorithm to improve the efficiency of search engines, designing a more user-friendly interface for a mobile application, testing the effectiveness of a new teaching method in computer science education. |

**(c) Distinguish between methodology and methods in research. (2 marks)**

**Methodology:** Refers to the overarching **strategy or philosophical approach** to conducting research. It is the system of principles and procedures that guide the entire research process.

**Methods:** Refers to the specific **techniques and procedures** used to collect and analyze data.

**(d) As a student, list five reasons why you have to make adequate referencing of your research work. (5 marks)**

1.  **Avoid Plagiarism:**  The most critical reason is to prevent plagiarism, which is a serious academic offense. Referencing clearly indicates which ideas and words are your own and which are borrowed from other sources. Proper referencing gives credit to the original authors and avoids presenting their work as your own.

2.  **Give Credit to Original Authors:** Academic integrity demands that you acknowledge the work of others that has influenced your research. Referencing is a way to respect intellectual property rights and give due recognition to the scholars and researchers whose work you have used.

3.  **Support Your Arguments and Claims:**  Referencing credible sources strengthens your arguments and claims. By citing established research, you demonstrate that your ideas are grounded in existing knowledge and supported by evidence. References provide authority and credibility to your work.

4.  **Demonstrate Breadth and Depth of Reading:**  Adequate referencing shows your examiner or reader that you have engaged with the relevant literature in your field. It demonstrates that you have conducted thorough research and are aware of the existing body of knowledge related to your topic. This indicates a deeper understanding of the subject matter.

5.  **Enable Readers to Verify Your Sources and Explore Further:**  A well-structured reference list allows readers to easily locate the sources you have used. This enables them to verify the accuracy of your citations, check the original context of the information, and explore the topic further if they wish.  Good referencing enhances the transparency and reproducibility of your research.

**(e) State two reasons why materials from web pages are often considered not so reliable for referencing. (2 marks)**

1.  **Lack of Peer Review:**  Many web pages, especially personal websites, blogs, and some organizational websites, do not undergo a rigorous peer-review process before publication. Peer review is a critical quality control mechanism in academic publishing where experts in the field evaluate the quality, validity, and originality of research before it is published. The absence of peer review on many web pages means there's no guarantee that the information is accurate, well-researched, or unbiased.  Anyone can publish almost anything online, regardless of its quality.

2.  **Authority and Credibility Concerns:** It can be difficult to ascertain the authority and credibility of the author or source of information on many web pages. Unlike scholarly publications where authors are typically experts in their field and affiliations are clear, web pages may be created by individuals or organizations with unclear credentials or potential biases. The lack of clear authorship, institutional affiliation, or editorial oversight makes it harder to assess the reliability and objectivity of the information presented on some web pages.

**Question 3**

5.  **Content Accuracy and Relevance:**
    *   Fact-check information
    *   Relevance to your message
    *   Cite sources (if needed)

**(c) Briefly describe the importance of 'Literature Review' in any scientific research reporting. (3 marks)**

1.  **Identifying Gaps and Justifying Research:**  A thorough literature review helps identify gaps in the existing research, inconsistencies in findings, or areas that have not been adequately explored. By highlighting these gaps, you justify the need for your own research and demonstrate its potential contribution to filling those gaps or resolving unanswered questions. 

2.  **Avoiding Redundancy and Building on Previous Work:** By reviewing existing literature, you avoid unnecessarily repeating research that has already been done. Instead, you can build upon previous findings, refine existing theories, or explore new directions based on the current state of knowledge.  It ensures your research is original and contributes meaningfully to the field.

3.  **Demonstrating Scholarly Rigor and Credibility:** A well-conducted literature review demonstrates your scholarly rigor and familiarity with your research area. It shows that you have engaged with the existing body of knowledge and are positioning your research within a scholarly context. This enhances the credibility and persuasiveness of your research report.

**(d) Time management has two part: managing Time and managing Goals. Explain. (2 marks)**

Time management is indeed about effectively managing two key aspects: **Time** itself and **Goals** you want to achieve within that time. 

1. **Managing Time:** Efficiently allocating and utilizing the available time.

2. **Managing Goals:** Defining, clarifying, and achieving desired outcomes within the managed time.
