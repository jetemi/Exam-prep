Okay, let's tackle the third set of Compiler Construction past questions.

**Question 1**

**(a) Parse Trees and Activities between Lexical and Syntax Analysis (2 + 4½ mks)**

**(i) Briefly describe the term parse tree as used in compiler design (2 mks)**

**Answer:**
As described in Set 1, Question 1a(i), a **parse tree** (or concrete syntax tree) is a hierarchical tree representation of the syntactic structure of a string according to a context-free grammar. It visually shows how the input source code is derived from the grammar rules.

*   **Nodes:** Internal nodes are non-terminals, leaf nodes are terminals (tokens).
*   **Structure:** Children of a node represent the right-hand side of the grammar rule applied to derive the non-terminal at that node. The root is the grammar's start symbol.
*   **Purpose:** To represent the syntactic structure, verify grammatical correctness, and provide a structured input for semantic analysis and subsequent compiler phases.

**(ii) With the aid of good diagram, explain the major activities taken place between the lexical analysis phase and syntax phase in compilation process (4½ mks)**

**Answer:**

```

     +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
                                         Symbol Table Interaction & Error Reporting
```

**Intermediate Activities between Lexical Analysis and Syntax Analysis:**

1.  **Token Stream Generation:** The primary output of the lexical analysis phase is a **token stream**. This is a sequence of tokens, where each token represents a lexeme from the source code along with its token type and possibly a value (e.g., identifier name, literal value). This token stream is the *input* to the syntax analysis phase.

2.  **Whitespace and Comment Removal:** Lexical analysis typically removes whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines) and comments from the source code. These are generally not needed by the syntax analyzer and subsequent phases.

3.  **Symbol Table Population (Initial Entries):** During lexical analysis, as identifiers are recognized, the lexical analyzer may start to populate the **symbol table**. It might enter the identifier name and basic information, like its token type (identifier). More detailed information (like type, scope, etc.) will be added in later phases, especially semantic analysis.

4.  **Lexical Error Detection and Reporting:** The lexical analyzer is responsible for detecting and reporting **lexical errors**. These are errors in the basic structure of tokens, such as invalid characters, unterminated strings, or numbers that are too large. When a lexical error is detected, the lexical analyzer should report it (error message, line number) and attempt to recover, possibly by skipping erroneous characters or trying to guess the intended token.

5.  **Passing Token Attributes:** Along with the token type, the lexical analyzer may pass additional attributes to the syntax analyzer. For example, for an `IDENTIFIER` token, it might pass the actual identifier name (string). For a `NUMBER` token, it might pass the numerical value. These attributes are stored with the tokens in the token stream and are used by the parser.

6.  **Line Number Tracking:** The lexical analyzer keeps track of line numbers in the source code. This is crucial for error reporting in subsequent phases. When an error is detected in syntax or semantic analysis, the error message can include the line number where the error occurred, making it easier for the programmer to locate the error in the source code.

In summary, the activities between lexical analysis and syntax analysis are primarily focused on preparing the token stream, handling basic errors, and setting up the initial symbol table, thus bridging the gap for the syntax analyzer to effectively process the program's structure.

**(b) Construct Parse Tree (5 mks)**

**Construct parse tree for: (i) E → E + E | E * E | id   (ii) S → SS* | ss+ | a**

**(i) E → E + E | E * E | id for input string `id + id * id`**

Since the grammar is ambiguous, let's assume standard operator precedence (* > +) and left associativity for both + and *. We want a parse tree that reflects `id + (id * id)`.

```
      E
     /|\
    E + E
   /   /|\
  id  E * E
     /   \
    id    id
```

**Parse Tree for `id + id * id` using E → E + E | E * E | id:**

1.  Start with `E`.
2.  Apply `E → E + E`.  Root is `+`, children are `E`, `E`.
3.  Left `E` to `id` (leaf).
4.  Right `E` to `E * E`. Root is `*`, children `E`, `E`.
5.  Left `E` under `*` to `id` (leaf).
6.  Right `E` under `*` to `id` (leaf).

**(ii) S → SS* | ss+ | a for input string `ssa*`**

It seems there might be a typo and `ss+` should be `ss` or `s+`. Assuming it's `SS*` and `a`, and input is meant to be derived using these.  Maybe input is `aa*` or `ass*` or `ssaa*`. Let's assume the rules are `S → SS* | a` and try to parse `aa*`. Still not making sense to derive 'a' then '*'.  Perhaps grammar is meant to be `S → SS* | a` and input is just `aa`.

Let's assume rules are `S → SS* | a` and we want to parse `aa*`. Still not directly applicable.

Let's reconsider the rules: `S → SS* | ss+ | a`.  Maybe `ss+` is supposed to mean "one or more 's's". If it's `ss+` as a literal, it's also unusual. If it's regular expression in grammar, it's not CFG anymore.

Let's assume rules are typo and should be: `S → SS | S* | a` or `S → SS | S+ | a`.  None of these perfectly fit to derive something with 's' and '*'.

Given the rules as written: `S → SS* | ss+ | a`, and trying to parse something like `ssa*` or `ass*`.  Let's try to parse something simpler, like just `a`.

Parse tree for `a`:

```
  S
  |
  a
```

Parse tree for `ss+` (assuming 'ss+' is a terminal symbol - which is unlikely in CFG context. Maybe it is intended to be two terminals 's', 's', and '+' as a separate token?): If 'ss+' is a terminal symbol, then:

```
  S
  |
  ss+
```

If we assume `ss+` is a typo and meant to be `s s` (two 's' terminals) or `s+` as regular expression part (again, unusual in CFG rule directly).

Let's assume the rules intended are simpler, and `ss+` is meant to be just `s` and `SS*` is meant to be `SS`.  Then rules are `S → SS | S* | a`. Still `S*` is problematic in CFG rules.

**Given the ambiguity and potential typos, I will proceed with the assumption that the grammar (ii) might have errors in its intended form. If we consider the rules as literally given, and treat 'ss+' and 'SS*' as terminal symbols, then parse trees become trivial if input matches a rule directly.**

If we assume input string meant for (ii) is just `a`, then parse tree is just:

```
  S
  |
  a
```

If we assume input string is `ss+` (and treat 'ss+' as a token), then parse tree is:

```
  S
  |
  ss+
```

If we assume input string is `SS*` (and treat 'SS*' as a token), then parse tree is:

```
  S
  |
  SS*
```

**Without clarification on the intended meaning of `ss+` and `SS*` in the grammar and the expected input string, providing a meaningful parse tree for grammar (ii) and a typical input string becomes challenging.  If we interpret `SS*` and `ss+` as grammar rules composed of terminals and non-terminals (which is more likely for CFG), then the given rules are incomplete or unclear for typical derivations.**

**(c) Write short notes on the following Specifications of Tokens: (i) Alphabets (ii) Strings (iii) Special Symbols (iv) Language (6 mks)**

**(i) Alphabets:**
In the context of lexical analysis and compiler design, an **alphabet** is a finite set of symbols. This set is the collection of all possible characters that can appear in the source code of a programming language. Examples of alphabets include:
*   **ASCII alphabet:** A set of 128 characters commonly used for English text and programming.
*   **Unicode alphabet:** A much larger set encompassing characters from almost all writing systems in the world.
*   For a specific programming language, the alphabet is the set of characters that are valid in source programs written in that language. The lexical analyzer reads characters from the input source code, which are elements of this alphabet.

**(ii) Strings:**
In compiler design, a **string** is a finite sequence of symbols (characters) chosen from an alphabet. Source code itself is a long string of characters. Lexemes are substrings of the source code that are identified and grouped together by the lexical analyzer.  For example, `"Hello, world!"` is a string literal, `variableName` is an identifier string, and `if` is a keyword string. Strings are fundamental to representing source code and its components.

**(iii) Special Symbols:**
**Special symbols** in programming languages are tokens that are not alphabetic or numeric identifiers, keywords, or standard literals. They include:
*   **Operators:** Symbols that perform operations, such as arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), relational operators (`<`, `>`, `==`), logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`), assignment operator (`=`), etc.
*   **Punctuation:** Symbols used for structuring code, such as semicolons (`;`), commas (`,`), parentheses (`()`), braces (`{}`), brackets (`[]`).
*   **Other Symbols:**  Symbols like `#`, `$`, `@`, `^`, `&`, `|`, `~`, depending on the programming language.
Special symbols have predefined meanings in the syntax and semantics of the language and are recognized as distinct tokens by the lexical analyzer.

**(iv) Language:**
In compiler design and formal language theory, a **language** is a set of strings over a particular alphabet. In the context of programming languages, a "language" refers to the set of all valid programs that can be written in that programming language. This set is usually infinite. The syntax of a programming language, defined by a grammar, specifies which strings of tokens are valid programs (i.e., belong to the language). The compiler's job is to process programs that are strings in this language and translate them into executable code. Formal language theory provides the mathematical framework to define, analyze, and process programming languages.

**Question 2**

**(a) Difference between the following pairs: (i) parse tree and syntax tree? (ii) top down parsing and bottom up parsing? (4 mks)**

**(i) Parse Tree and Syntax Tree (Abstract Syntax Tree - AST):**

| Feature          | Parse Tree (Concrete Syntax Tree)             | Syntax Tree (Abstract Syntax Tree - AST)        |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**      | To show the full derivation of the input according to the grammar rules. Emphasizes syntactic details. | To represent the essential syntactic structure of the program, abstracting away from parsing details. Emphasizes semantic structure. |
| **Nodes**         | Internal nodes: non-terminals, Leaf nodes: terminals (tokens). | Nodes represent program constructs (e.g., expressions, statements, declarations).  Terminals and non-terminals may not be directly present as nodes in the same way as in parse trees. |
| **Content**       | Contains all terminals and non-terminals from the derivation. Shows every step of parsing. | Abstracted representation. Omits details like punctuation, keywords used only for syntax, and non-essential non-terminals. Focuses on the semantically meaningful parts of the program. |
| **Size**          | Generally larger and more detailed.             | More compact and smaller.                        |
| **Example**       | Shows parentheses, keywords like `begin`, `end`, etc., explicitly if present in grammar. | May not explicitly represent parentheses or keywords if they are only for syntactic grouping and not semantically important. |
| **Use in Compiler**| Primarily used to illustrate parsing process and grammar.  Less directly used in later compiler phases due to redundancy. | Used as the primary data structure for semantic analysis, intermediate code generation, and optimization. Provides a cleaner and more abstract representation for further processing. |

**(ii) Top-Down Parsing and Bottom-Up Parsing:**

| Feature              | Top-Down Parsing                               | Bottom-Up Parsing                              |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Parsing Direction** | Starts from the start symbol and tries to derive the input string by predicting grammar rules.  | Starts from the input string (tokens) and tries to reduce it back to the start symbol by recognizing grammar rules in reverse. |
| **Tree Construction**  | Builds the parse tree from root to leaves (pre-order or depth-first manner). | Builds the parse tree from leaves to root (post-order or reverse rightmost derivation). |
| **Approach**          | Predictive parsing. Tries to predict which production to apply based on the current non-terminal and lookahead tokens. | Shift-reduce parsing. Shifts input tokens onto a stack and reduces sequences of tokens (handles) on the stack according to grammar rules. |
| **Grammars**          | Typically works well with LL grammars (Left-to-right, Leftmost derivation). Grammars should be non-left-recursive and often require left-factoring. | Typically works with LR grammars (Left-to-right, Rightmost derivation in reverse). Can handle a wider class of grammars, including left-recursive grammars. |
| **Examples**          | Recursive Descent Parsing, LL(1) Parsing.       | Shift-Reduce Parsing, LR(0), SLR(1), LALR(1), LR(1) Parsing. |
| **Error Handling**    | Can be more challenging to implement effective error recovery.                                | Generally, error recovery mechanisms are better understood and often easier to implement. |
| **Conceptual View**   | Derivation process from start to input.         | Reverse derivation process from input to start. |

**(b) What is the major role of parser in compiler? (2 mks)**

**Answer:**
The major role of the **parser** (syntax analyzer) in a compiler is to:

1.  **Verify Syntactic Correctness:** Check if the input token stream (from the lexical analyzer) conforms to the grammatical rules (syntax) of the programming language. This means ensuring that the program is well-formed according to the language's grammar.

2.  **Construct Syntactic Structure:**  If the input is syntactically correct, the parser constructs a hierarchical representation of the program's structure, typically a parse tree or an abstract syntax tree (AST). This structure represents how the different parts of the program are related according to the grammar.

In essence, the parser ensures the program is grammatically valid and provides a structured representation (AST) that is used by subsequent compiler phases for semantic analysis and code generation. If the program is not syntactically valid, the parser detects and reports syntax errors.

**(c) (i) With the aid of a good diagram, describe two phases of compiler based on the way they compile. (5½ mks)**

**Answer:**

We can classify compilers based on the number of passes they make over the source code or intermediate representations. Let's describe **Single-Pass Compiler** and **Two-Pass Compiler** with diagrams.

**(1) Single-Pass Compiler:**

```

```

**Description of Single-Pass Compiler:**

*   **Process:** Performs all phases of compilation (lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, intermediate code generation, and code generation) in a single pass over the source code.
*   **Data Flow:**  Source code is read once. Tokens are generated, parsed, semantically analyzed, and target code is generated essentially in a sequential, integrated manner.
*   **Constraints:** Grammars must be simple (often LL grammars). Forward references (using an identifier before its declaration) can be problematic and require workarounds. Optimization is limited.
*   **Advantages:** Fast compilation speed.
*   **Disadvantages:** Limited optimization capabilities, restrictions on language features and grammar complexity.
*   **Example Languages:**  Original Pascal implementations, some assemblers.

```

**Description of Two-Pass Compiler:**

*   **Process:** Compilation is divided into two main passes over the source code.
    *   **Pass 1 (Front End - Analysis):** Performs lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, and often intermediate code generation. Builds a symbol table.
    *   **Pass 2 (Back End - Synthesis):** Performs code optimization and code generation. Uses the symbol table created in Pass 1.
*   **Data Flow:** Pass 1 processes the entire source code and creates an intermediate representation and a symbol table. Pass 2 reads the intermediate code and symbol table from Pass 1 to generate the target code.
*   **Advantages:** Allows for better optimization compared to single-pass. Can handle forward references more easily. More flexibility in grammar and language features.
*   **Disadvantages:** Slower compilation speed compared to single-pass compilers.
*   **Example Languages:**  Many compilers for Fortran, C.

**(c) (ii) There are a number of algebraic laws that are obeyed by regular expressions, which can be used to manipulate regular expressions into equivalent forms. State various operations on languages (6 mks)**

This question seems to be asking about operations on languages, not algebraic laws of regular expressions.  Assuming it's about language operations, as in Question 1c of Set 1.

As in Question 1c of Set 1, the operations on languages are:

1.  **Union (∪)**
2.  **Intersection (∩)**
3.  **Concatenation (.)**
4.  **Kleene Closure (*)**
5.  **Positive Closure (+)**
6.  **Set Difference (-)**
7.  **Reversal (<sup>R</sup>)**

**(Detailed explanations and examples for each operation were provided in the answer to Question 1c of Set 1.  Refer to that answer for detailed descriptions and examples.)**

**Question 3**

**(a) If r and s are regular expressions denoting the languages L(r) and L(s), state the expression for the following notations: (i) Union (ii) Concatenation (iii) Kleene closure (4½ mks)**

As answered in Question 6c of Set 1:

**(i) Union:** `r | s`
**(ii) Concatenation:** `rs` (or `r.s`)
**(iii) Kleene Closure:** `r*`

**(b) If x is a regular expression in a programming language, state the following valid tokens representation: (i) x* (ii) x+ (iii) x? (4½ mks)**

**(i) x* (Kleene Star):**

*   **Representation:**  Matches zero or more occurrences of the pattern represented by `x`.
*   **Language:** L(x*) = {ε} ∪ L(x) ∪ L(x)L(x) ∪ L(x)L(x)L(x) ∪ ...  (set of strings formed by concatenating zero or more strings from L(x)).
*   **Example (Regex):** If `x` is `a`, then `a*` matches: "", "a", "aa", "aaa", ...

**(ii) x+ (Positive Closure):**

*   **Representation:** Matches one or more occurrences of the pattern represented by `x`.
*   **Language:** L(x+) = L(x) ∪ L(x)L(x) ∪ L(x)L(x)L(x) ∪ ... (set of strings formed by concatenating one or more strings from L(x)).  Equivalent to `xx*` or `x.x*`.
*   **Example (Regex):** If `x` is `a`, then `a+` matches: "a", "aa", "aaa", ... (but *not* "").

**(iii) x? (Optional):**

*   **Representation:** Matches zero or one occurrence of the pattern represented by `x`.  Makes `x` optional.
*   **Language:** L(x?) = {ε} ∪ L(x) (set containing the empty string and all strings in L(x)).
*   **Example (Regex):** If `x` is `a`, then `a?` matches: "", "a".

**(c) (i) Define compiler and state its types (3 mks)**

**Definition of Compiler:**
A **compiler** is a program that translates source code written in a high-level programming language into a target language, typically assembly language or machine code, which can be understood and executed by a computer.

**Types of Compilers (as in Set 1, Question 3c(ii), and Set 2, Question 2c):**

1.  **Based on Number of Passes:** Single-pass, Two-pass, Multi-pass.
2.  **Based on Target Machine:** Native, Cross-compiler.
3.  **Based on Output:** Compiler to machine code, assembly code, bytecode, source-to-source (transpiler).
4.  **Based on Optimization Level:** Non-optimizing, Optimizing.
5.  **Based on Implementation Language:** Self-hosting, Bootstrapping.
6.  **Based on Compilation Process:** JIT (Just-in-Time), AOT (Ahead-of-Time).

**(c) (ii) What is YACC in compiler design? (2½ mks)**

**Answer:**
**YACC** (Yet Another Compiler-Compiler) is a classic parser generator tool. It is a program that takes a grammar specification as input and generates source code for a parser (typically in C).

*   **Parser Generator:** YACC automates the process of creating a parser. Instead of manually writing parser code, developers provide a grammar specification in YACC's format.
*   **LALR(1) Parser:** YACC generates an LALR(1) (Look-Ahead LR) parser. LALR(1) is a type of bottom-up parser that is powerful enough to handle most programming language grammars efficiently.
*   **Input to YACC:** A YACC specification file (usually with `.y` extension) contains:
    *   **Grammar Rules:**  Production rules of the context-free grammar defining the language's syntax.
    *   **Actions:**  C code snippets associated with grammar rules. These actions are executed when a reduction is performed by the parser. Actions can be used to build syntax trees, perform semantic checks, generate intermediate code, etc.
    *   **Token Declarations:**  Definitions of tokens expected from the lexical analyzer (scanner).
*   **Output of YACC:** YACC generates a C source file (usually `y.tab.c`) containing the parser code. This code includes parsing tables and parsing functions based on the LALR(1) parsing algorithm.
*   **Usage:**  YACC is often used in conjunction with a lexical analyzer generator like Lex (Flex). Lex generates the scanner, and YACC generates the parser. The output of Lex (token stream) is fed into the parser generated by YACC.

**(c) (iii) Distinguish between SLR(1) and LR(0) as used in compiler design (3 mks)**

As answered in Question 3c(iii) of Set 1:

| Feature             | LR(0) Parser                                   | SLR(1) Parser                                      |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Parsing Power**   | Weakest in LR family.                             | Stronger than LR(0).                                |
| **Lookahead**       | No lookahead.                                   | Uses 1-symbol lookahead (FOLLOW sets).             |
| **Conflict Resolution** | Suffers from conflicts more often.               | Resolves some conflicts using FOLLOW sets.          |
| **Construction**    | Simple to construct.                               | Slightly more complex (using FOLLOW sets).         |
| **Applicability**    | Rarely used practically.                         | More practical than LR(0). Still limited compared to LALR(1) and LR(1). |
| **Conflict Condition** | Conflicts if shift/reduce or reduce/reduce in LR(0) item sets. | SLR(1) resolves some conflicts based on lookahead and FOLLOW sets. |

**Question 4**

**(a) (i) What do you understand by the term "three address code" in compiler design? (2 mks)**

As answered in Question 4a(i) of Set 1:

**Three-Address Code (TAC)** is an intermediate representation (IR) in compilers, where each instruction has at most three operands (addresses): two sources and one result. It uses temporary variables and includes instructions for assignments, arithmetic, logical operations, data transfer, control flow (jumps), and procedure calls. Example: `x = y op z`.

**(b) (ii) Briefly describe the term token as used in yacc? (2½ mks)**

**Answer:**
In YACC (and generally in compiler design), a **token** represents a terminal symbol in the grammar. Tokens are the basic building blocks of the syntax that the parser processes.

*   **Input from Lexer:** Tokens are produced by the lexical analyzer (e.g., generated by Lex/Flex) and are the *input* to the parser generated by YACC.
*   **Terminal Symbols:** In the YACC grammar specification, tokens are declared as `%token` directives. These token names become terminal symbols in the grammar rules.
*   **Token Type and Value:**  A token typically has:
    *   **Token Type (Token Name):** A symbolic name (identifier) representing the category of the token (e.g., `IDENTIFIER`, `NUMBER`, `PLUS`, `KEYWORD_IF`). This name is used in the grammar rules in YACC.
    *   **Token Value (Attribute):**  Optional additional information associated with the token, such as the actual lexeme (string of characters) or a numerical value. In YACC, this value is often stored in the `yylval` variable, which is a union that can hold different types of values.
*   **Example in YACC specification:**
    ```yacc
    %token IDENTIFIER NUMBER PLUS
    ```
    Here, `IDENTIFIER`, `NUMBER`, and `PLUS` are declared as tokens.  Grammar rules in YACC then use these token names.  For instance:
    ```yacc
    expression : expression PLUS term { $$ = $1 + $3; }
               | term
               ;
    ```
    Here, `PLUS` is a token.  The lexical analyzer must return tokens of type `PLUS` when it encounters a `'+'` operator in the input source code.

**(c) (i) Outline six applications of compilers (6 mks)**

**Answer:**
Compilers have numerous applications beyond just translating high-level language programs to machine code:

1.  **Programming Language Implementation:** The primary application is to create compilers for programming languages (like C, Java, Python, C++). These compilers enable software development by allowing programmers to write code in high-level languages and execute it on computers.

2.  **Cross-Compilation:** Compilers are used for cross-compilation, where code is compiled on one platform (host) to run on a different platform (target). This is essential for embedded systems development, mobile app development targeting different architectures (ARM, x86, etc.).

3.  **Source-to-Source Translation (Transpilation):** Compilers can translate code from one high-level language to another. Examples include:
    *   TypeScript to JavaScript.
    *   CoffeeScript to JavaScript.
    *   Modern C++ to older C++ standards.
    *   High-level synthesis tools that translate high-level descriptions of hardware into hardware description languages (like Verilog or VHDL).

4.  **Optimization Tools:**  Compiler optimization techniques are used in various tools beyond compilers themselves. For example, program optimizers, performance analysis tools, and static analysis tools often use compiler-like techniques for code analysis and transformation.

5.  **Virtual Machine Implementation:** Compilers are used to compile code to bytecode for virtual machines (like JVM for Java, CLR for .NET). These virtual machines then interpret or JIT-compile the bytecode for execution on different platforms, enabling platform independence.

6.  **Domain-Specific Language (DSL) Processing:** Compilers and compiler construction principles are used to create processors for Domain-Specific Languages. DSLs are specialized languages designed for particular application domains (e.g., SQL for databases, regular expressions for pattern matching, configuration languages). Compilers for DSLs can translate DSL code into executable code or other forms suitable for the domain.

7.  **Code Generation for Specific Hardware:** Compilers can be tailored to generate code optimized for specific hardware architectures, such as GPUs, DSPs, or specialized processors, to take advantage of their unique features and improve performance for specific tasks (e.g., graphics processing, signal processing).

**(c) (ii) Enumerate four differences between compiler and interpreter (4 mks)**

As answered in Question 2c of Set 2:

| Feature           | Compiler                                    | Interpreter                                    |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Translation**    | Translates entire program before execution. | Translates and executes line by line.         |
| **Execution Speed**| Generally faster execution.                 | Generally slower execution.                  |
| **Error Reporting**| Errors reported after compilation.          | Errors reported during execution (line-by-line). |
| **Target Code**    | Generates separate target code (executable).  | No separate target code (typically).          |

**(c) (iii) The cross-compiler is used to implement the compiler, characterized by three languages, state these three languages (3 mks)**

As answered in Question 4c(ii) of Set 1:

The three languages characterizing a cross-compiler are:

1.  **Source Language:** The language of the program being compiled.
2.  **Implementation Language (Compiler Writing Language):** The language in which the compiler itself is written.
3.  **Target Language:** The language that the compiler outputs (machine code for the target machine).

**Question 5**

**(a) * (i) A finite automaton (M) is an abstract machine that serves as a recognizer for the strings that comprise a regular language and is defined by using five (5) tuples. State and briefly describe finite automata (M) symbols (5 mks)**

As answered in Question 3b of Set 1:

A Finite Automaton (FA) is defined as a 5-tuple: **M = (Q, Σ, δ, q<sub>0</sub>, F)**

1.  **Q:** Finite set of **states**.
2.  **Σ:** Finite set of **input symbols** (alphabet).
3.  **δ:** **Transition function:** δ: Q × Σ → Q (for DFA) or δ: Q × Σ → P(Q) (for NFA).
4.  **q<sub>0</sub>:** **Start state** (q<sub>0</sub> ∈ Q).
5.  **F:** Set of **accept states** (F ⊆ Q).

**(a) * (ii) The lexical structure of more or less every programming language can be specified by a regular language. State and briefly describe finite automata (M) symbols (5 mks)**

This seems to be a repetition or slight variation of 5a(i).  It's stating the importance of regular languages in lexical analysis and asking to describe FA symbols again.  The description of FA symbols is the same as in 5a(i).

**Brief description of FA symbols (again):**

1.  **Q (States):**  Represent different conditions or stages the automaton can be in while processing input. Finite in number for FA.

2.  **Σ (Alphabet):** Set of all possible input symbols the automaton can read. Finite set.

3.  **δ (Transition Function):** Defines how the automaton moves from one state to another based on the input symbol read.  Deterministic (DFA): one next state, Non-deterministic (NFA): set of possible next states.

4.  **q<sub>0</sub> (Start State):** The initial state where the automaton begins processing input.

5.  **F (Accept States):** A subset of states. If the automaton ends in an accept state after processing the entire input string, the string is accepted (recognized).

**(b) (i) State three common ways to implement a lexical analysis in a finite state machine design (3 mks)**

As answered in Question 5a(ii) of Set 1:

Three common ways to implement lexical analysis using FSMs are:

1.  **Regular Expressions to NFAs/DFAs (using tools like Lex/Flex):**  Automated conversion of regex to DFA and code generation.
2.  **Hand-Coded DFA:** Manual design and implementation of DFA in code (e.g., using switch statements or state tables).
3.  **Table-Driven Lexical Analyzer:**  Using transition tables and action tables to drive a generic lexical analyzer engine.

**(b) (ii) State the structure in each of Lex & Yacc program in compiler design (3 mks)**

**Structure of a Lex Program (.l file):**

```lex
%{
  /* C declarations and includes (optional) */
%}

/* Definitions section (optional) */
/* Regular expression definitions using names */

%%
/* Rules section */
/* Regular expression { Action (C code) } */
/* ... more rules ... */
%%

/* User code section (optional) */
/* C functions and main() function if needed */
```

**Sections in a Lex (.l) file:**

1.  **Definitions Section (Optional):**
    *   Enclosed in `%{ %}`.
    *   C code declarations, include statements, global variables.
    *   Regular expression definitions (macros) to make rules more readable and reusable.

2.  **Rules Section (Required):**
    *   Separated by `%%` from the definitions section and user code section.
    *   Contains rules of the form: `pattern { action }`.
    *   `pattern`: Regular expression that defines a token's lexeme.
    *   `action`: C code to be executed when the pattern is matched. Typically returns a token type (and optionally a token value) to the parser.

3.  **User Code Section (Optional):**
    *   Separated by the second `%%` from the rules section.
    *   C code functions that may be used in the actions of the rules section.
    *   Can contain the `main()` function if you want to create a standalone lexical analyzer for testing.

**Structure of a Yacc Program (.y file):**

```yacc
%{
  /* C declarations and includes (optional) */
%}

%token /* Token declarations (terminal symbols) */
/* ... token names ... */

%nonterm /* Non-terminal declarations (optional) */
/* ... non-terminal names ... */

/* Grammar rules section */
%%
start_symbol: /* Grammar rules with actions */
              rule 1 { /* Action 1 (C code) */ }
            | rule 2 { /* Action 2 (C code) */ }
            ...
            ;
/* ... more grammar rules ... */
%%

/* User code section (optional) */
/* C functions, main() function, error handling routines */
```

**Sections in a Yacc (.y) file:**

1.  **Declarations Section (Optional):**
    *   Enclosed in `%{ %}`.
    *   C code declarations, include statements, global variables.
    *   Token declarations using `%token` to define terminal symbols (tokens from lexer).
    *   Non-terminal declarations using `%nonterm` (optional).
    *   Operator precedence and associativity declarations (`%left`, `%right`, `%nonassoc`, `%precedence`).

2.  **Grammar Rules Section (Required):**
    *   Enclosed between `%%` and `%%`.
    *   Contains grammar rules in BNF-like format: `nonterminal : rule1 | rule2 | ... ;`.
    *   Each rule has an associated action (C code enclosed in `{ }`) that is executed when the rule is reduced during parsing. Actions often build syntax trees, perform semantic checks, or generate intermediate code.

3.  **User Code Section (Optional):**
    *   After the second `%%`.
    *   C code functions that may be used in actions of grammar rules.
    *   `main()` function (often contains call to `yyparse()` to start parsing).
    *   Error handling functions (like `yyerror()`).

**(c) (i) With the aid of diagram only, describe the lexical analyzer generator (3½ mks)**

As answered in Question 5b(ii) of Set 1.  Refer to the diagram and explanation provided in that answer.

**(c) (ii) Differentiate between Linker and Loader in compiler design (2 mks)**

| Feature        | Linker                                                                 | Loader                                                                     |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**    | Resolves external references and combines object files to create an executable. | Loads an executable program into memory and prepares it for execution.        |
| **Input**      | Object files (and libraries).                                         | Executable file (output from linker).                                       |
| **Output**     | Executable file (or a shared library).                                 | Program loaded into memory, ready to run.                                   |
| **Process**    | - Resolves symbolic references between object files.                     | - Allocates memory for the program.                                          |
|                | - Combines code and data segments from multiple object files.           | - Loads code and data into allocated memory.                                  |
|                | - Performs relocation (adjusts addresses).                             | - Performs relocation (if needed at load time, though often done by linker). |
|                | - Creates a single executable file.                                     | - Initializes registers and sets up execution environment.                  |
| **Timing**     | Performed *after* compilation and *before* execution.                    | Performed *at* program execution time (when the program is started).         |
| **Analogy**    | Like assembling pieces of furniture together.                            | Like placing the assembled furniture in a room and getting ready to use it.   |

**Question 6**

**(a) In tabular form, explain Noam Chomsky classification of four classes of languages using (7½ mks)**

As answered in Question 6a of Set 1:

| Type (Level) | Grammar Type           | Restrictions on Productions (P)                                      | Advantages                                                                    | Disadvantages                                                                     |
|--------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Type-0**   | Unrestricted Grammar   | No restrictions.                                                     | Most general.                                                                  | Very complex to parse.                                                          |
| **Type-1**   | Context-Sensitive Grammar (CSG) | αAβ → αγβ, |α| ≤ |β| (except S → ε).                     | More powerful than CFGs.                                                      | Difficult to parse, less practical.                                             |
| **Type-2**   | Context-Free Grammar (CFG)   | A → α.                                                               | Simple parsing, used for programming language syntax.                        | Cannot describe all syntax aspects.                                              |
| **Type-3**   | Regular Grammar        | Right-Regular: A → aB, A → a, A → ε. Left-Regular: A → Ba, A → a, A → ε. | Simplest. Efficient recognition with FAs. Used for lexical analysis.            | Least powerful, limited syntax structures.                                      |

**(b) (i) What are the four components of a context-free grammar (4 mks)**

As answered in Question 4b of Set 1:

The four components of a Context-Free Grammar (CFG) G = (V, T, P, S) are:

1.  **V:** Set of **non-terminal symbols**.
2.  **T:** Set of **terminal symbols**.
3.  **P:** Set of **production rules**.
4.  **S:** **Start symbol**.

**(b) (ii) Given the context free grammar with productions rules: A → A + A | A * A | a Determine if the above production is ambiguous or not using suitable parse tree to generate the string a + a + a (3 mks)**

**Grammar:** A → A + A | A * A | a

**String:** `a + a + a`

**Parse Tree 1 (Left Associative for +):** `(a + a) + a`

```
      A
     /|\
    A + A
   /   /|\
  A + A   A
  |   |   |
  a   a   a
```

**Parse Tree 2 (Right Associative for +):** `a + (a + a)`

```
      A
     /|\
    A + A
   /   /|\
  A   A + A
  |   |   |
  a   a   a
```

**Parse Tree 3 (Mixed, though less standard for same precedence operator, but possible structurally):** `(a + a) + a` - same structure as Parse Tree 1, still different derivation path possible.

**Parse Tree 4 (Mixed, though less standard):** `a + (a + a)` - same structure as Parse Tree 2, still different derivation path possible.

**Conclusion:**  Even for `a + a + a`, there are at least two distinct parse trees (left-associative and right-associative for '+').  Therefore, the grammar **A → A + A | A * A | a is ambiguous** because there exists at least one string (`a + a + a` in this case) that has more than one parse tree.

**(b) (iii) Consider the production rules: E → E + E | E * E | E - E | id Generates the available parse trees for the string id + id - id, for the grammar in 6b (iii) above (3 mks)**

**Grammar:** E → E + E | E * E | E - E | id

**String:** `id + id - id`

Let's assume operators + and - have same precedence and are left-associative, and * has higher precedence. For `id + id - id`, operators are of same precedence, so left-associativity applies: `(id + id) - id`.

**Parse Tree 1 (Left Associative (+ and -)):** `(id + id) - id`

```
      E
     /|\
    E - E
   /   /|\
  E + E   E
 /   \   |
id    id  id
```

**Parse Tree 2 (If we incorrectly assume right associativity for + and - , e.g., id + (id - id) ):**

```
      E
     /|\
    E + E
   /   /|\
  id  E - E
     /   \
    id    id
```

**Parse Tree 3 (If we consider operator precedence in different way, e.g., + with higher precedence than - , which is not standard for + and -):** `id + (id - id)` - same tree as Parse Tree 2.

**For `id + id - id` with standard left-associativity for + and -, the most natural parse tree is Parse Tree 1, representing `(id + id) - id`. However, due to the grammar structure `E → E + E | E - E | E * E | id`, it is still possible to construct other parse trees that might interpret the associativity or precedence differently if we are not strict about left-associativity for same-precedence operators.**

**Considering standard left-associativity for + and - and precedence rules, Parse Tree 1 is the primarily intended one. However, the grammar itself is still inherently ambiguous, allowing for different parse structures if associativity and precedence are interpreted differently.**

This completes the detailed solutions for the third set of past questions. Let me know if you have any further questions or need any clarifications!
